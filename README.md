# KiwiTabata

Tabata timer which announces in which interval you currently are.


# Version 2 should do this better:
* Better usage of router (Instead of working with "CSS-Hacks" and *ngIf to display the appropriate components, use the router to show the relevant parts) 
* Include animations when changing routes
* Access SASS-Variables in TypeScript
* Instead of positioning some elements with "old"-CSS statements like margin and top/left, only use flexbox (angular-flex)
